## Workflow

We are both collaborators on the same repo and will both commit changes.

### Task 1: Brian - You should remove a file other than index.html.

### Task 2: Carolyn - Slack your partner. You should both edit five CSS properties.

### Task 3: Brian - You should create an array of objects. Each object should have a name and age.

### Task 4: Carolyn - Slack your partner. You should both create an array of numbers in a Javascript file, if there isn't one. Write a function that multiplies them together.
